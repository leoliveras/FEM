C
C NPOIN Total number of nodal points in the structure.

C NELEM Total number of elements in the structure.

C NBOUN Total number of boundary points, i.e. nodal points at which the value of the unknown
C       is prescribed. In this context an internal node can be a boundary node.

C NMATS Total number of different materials in the structure.

C NPROP The number of material parameters required to define the characteristics of a material completely:
C       4-For elasto-plastic problems,
C       2-For all other applications.

C NNODE Number of nodes per element. For linear displacement onedimensional elements this equals 2.

C NINCS The number of increments in which the total loading is to be applied.

C NALGO Indicator used to identify the type of solution algorithm to be employed:
        !   l-Direct iteration
        !  2-Newton-Raphson method for quasi-harmonic problems. Tangential stiffness method 
        !  for structural problems (nonlinear elastic and elasto-plastic situations).
        !  3-Initial stiffness method.
        !  4-Combination of the initial and tangential stiffness methods,where the 
        !  stiffnesses are recalculated on the first iteration of aload increment only.
        !  5-Combination of the initial and tangential stiffness methods,
        !  where the stiffnesses are recalculated on the second iteration of
        !  a load increment only. This can aid the rate of convergence
        !  considerably, if on the application of an increment of load
        !  there is substantial further yielding. When calculating the
        !  element stiffnesses the total plastic strains evaluated during
        !  the previous iteration are used to indicate whether the element
        !  has yielded or not. If the elerhent stiffnesses are recalculated on
        !  the first iteration, the elements which have now yielded may
        !  have been elastic at the end of the orevious load increment and
        !  behaviour. This can reduce the convergence rate of the process
        !  since generally, whereas the elastic stiffness depends linearly on E. 
        !  Hence the tangential stiffness calculated grossly overestimates the true material
        !  response. This problem can be alleviated by reformulating the
        !  element stiffnesses during the second iteration of a load increment 
        !  rather than the first, since the plastic strain evaluated on
        !  the :first iteration will indicate yielding to have initiated

C NDOFN The number of degrees of freedom per nodal point:
C l-For uniaxial problems.
C 2-For beam' bending problems (considered in Chapter 5).

C For the one-dimensional situation being currently considered, the
C position of each nodal point is completely defined by a single coordinate
C whose value will be stored in the array
C COORD (IPOIN)
C IPOIN corresponds to the number of the nodal point


C LNODS (NUMEL, INODE) the element topology is read into this array
C NUMEL corresponds to the number of the element under consideration 
C INODE ranges from 1 to NNODE

C*******************************   Material properties   ****************************************************
C************************************************************************************************************

C MATNO (NUMEL) each element may conceivably be assigned different material properties,
C               so that element number NUMEL has material properties of type MATNO (NUMEL).

C PROPS (NUMAT, IPROP) the same array wiLL be employed for the material properties required for solution
C NUMAT denotes the material identification number
C IPROP the individual property. 


C (a) Quasi-harmonic problems
C     PROPS (NUMAT, l)-The reference value Ko of the coefficient K 
C     PROPS (NUMAT, 2)-The constant b for a linear ‘stiffness' variation.
C (b) Nonlinear elastic problems
C     PROPS (NUMAT, l)-The reference value Eo
C     PROPS (NUMAT, 2)-The cross-sectional area A, of the element. Each
C                      element with a different cross-sectional area must 
C                      be assigned a different material property number.
C (c) Elasto-plastic problems
C     PROPS (NUMAT, 1)-The elastic modulus, E, of the material.
C     PROPS (NUMAT, 2)-The cross-sectional area, A, of the element.
C     PROPS (NUMAT, 3)-The uniaxial yield stress of the material.
C     PROPS (NUMAT, 4)-The linear strain hardening parameter, H', for the material 

C NODFX temporary variable that describe any nodal points at which a degree of freedom has a prescribed value
C ICODE (IDOFN) entries in the array that determine which degrees of freedom are to be prescribed at this node
C               Variable IDOFN ranges over the number of degrees of freedom per node NDOFN. 
C               NDOFN = 1 -> degree of freedom IDOFN at node NODFX has a prescribed value
C               NCODE = 0 -> degree of freedom IDOFN at node NODFX is a free variable.
C VALUE (IDOFN) value for a prescribed degree of freedom (if ICODE (IDOFN) =0, then VALUE (IDOFN) is ignored)

CTo simplify solution process, information stored in arrays ICODE and VALUE is transferred to much larger arrays:
C IFPRE (NPOSN) --> NPOSN ranges over all the degrees of freedom for the whole finite element mesh,
C                   unit entries in IFPRE indicate that the associated variable is prescribed
C PEFIX (NPOSN) --> Position in PEFIX corresponding to the prescribed value
